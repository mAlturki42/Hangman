# Hangman

A a C++ program that allow the user to play the game Hangman.  Hangman is traditionally a paper & pencil game.  One player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters that may be in the word.  Your program will be player one, by pulling a word from a “word bank” and then player two is the user of your program.  The game is over when one of two things happen:
•	The user correctly completes the word.
•	The user incorrectly guesses a letter six times.
